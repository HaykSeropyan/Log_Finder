This is my take on Exercise 26 of Zed A Shaw's Learn C The Hard way. It a C program that searched the current directory for text files that contain a specified word.



It a very basic C program that searches the directory it is in for text files( you can edit the code to search for any glob supported pattern, this one just lookes at the pattern " *.txt " for a specified word.

it very basic in nature and is just my take on the exercise in the book. it has a lot of improvements.
